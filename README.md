This is currently my audio engineering project (started 18/08/2025)

## Reason for this project
I am doing this to learn C++ by utilising it in an actual project, I also do have an interest in music production and audio engineering and so this is in a way a stepping block



## Objectives:
*  ~Get PortAudio to work on microphone input~
*  ~Have ascii representation of microphone input volume on console~
*  ~Get PortAudio to on WAV files (PCM input) and have ascii working on that too~
*  Apply FFT to audio inputs to be able to map out the frequency (using ascii on console)
*  Make an additive oscillator (with frequency, amplitude, waveform type)
*  try to make a GUI using SFML (just a simple gui to allow for user control of features)
*  (this is a challenge) *Use OpenGL for the audio visualisation to make it look cool*
